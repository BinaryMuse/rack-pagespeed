_rack-pagespeed_ is a "port" of [modpagespeed](http://modpagespeed.com) to Rack. It's still a work in progress in the sense that there's a handful of filters that aren't there yet, and it hasn't been thoroughly tested, so if you're planning on using it, make sure you do at least a cursory check of your app/website to ensure everything's looking good.

Check the [project's page](http://rack-pagespeed.heroku.com) for docs!
