# rack-pagespeed

This middleware _will_ (as in this is a work in progress) replicate possibly every feature found in Google's [modpagespeed](http://www.modpagespeed.com/).

# To do

Everything. I'm just reserving the name for now.

# Where's rack-bundle?

I kept it in a branch called `bundle`. Though I strongly recommend you _not_ to use it. You can get the same effect (better actually, considering rack-pagespeed doesn't do some dumb stuff rack-bundle used to) by activating only the equivalent features in rack-pagespeed.

It's as free as sneezing. Just [give me credit](http://twitter.com/julio_ody) if you make some extraordinary out of this.
